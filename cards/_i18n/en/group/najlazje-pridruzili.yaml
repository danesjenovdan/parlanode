  title: Most likely to vote the same
  info: >-
    # List of 5 MPs that most often vote the same as the "vote of the
    parliamentary group". MPs are ranked in an ascending order. The lower the
    value, the bigger the commonalities between the two MPs.


    We calculate the Euclidean distance between the results of a parliamentary
    group's voting and everyone else's voting (votes are converted to numerical
    values between -1 and 1).


    When we calculate the "distance" between all the MPs we rank them based on
    result and show the top 5.


    The numerical values of votes


    * -1: against

    * 0: abstained or absent

    * 1: for

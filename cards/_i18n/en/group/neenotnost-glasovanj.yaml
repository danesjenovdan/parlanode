  title: Vote discord
  info: >-
    # Vote discord within the selected parliamentary group for voting events in
    the National Assembly compared to the average and maximum value of disparity
    within all the parliamentary groups.


    For each voting event we count which ballot (FOR, AGAINST, ABSTAINED,
    ABSENT) was submitted by the parliamentary group's MPs. We calculate the
    percentage of those who voted for the most popular option. That percentage
    is subtracted from 100 to get the level of discord i. e. the percentage of
    MPs who did not vote the same as the majority.

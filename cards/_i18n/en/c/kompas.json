      "For each MP we gather information about their voting history (or times when they where absent). We compare each MP's voting history with the voting history of all other MPs and we count how many times each two MPs voted the same. Results are represented in a two dimensional matrix (columns and lines are MPs, Xi,j value represents the number of times two MPs voted the same - MPs are marked as i and j). Then the matrix is split into sub-matrices each holding their respective value. ",
      "The algorithm returns three matrices - u, s and V-transpose. The best way to think about V-transpose is as a new selection of MPs' coordinates. We select the two coordinates from V-transpose that explain the previous matrix the best and visualise them in a two dimensional coordinate system.",
      "The first matrix is best described as representing MPs in an N-dimensional space (N is the number of voting events that are being compared). The algorithm maps N dimensions to 2 dimensions, with the priority of maintaining the distance between the MPs. Further apart the two MPs, greater the difference in their voting history."

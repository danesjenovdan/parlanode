    # All MPs are positioned in a coordinate space by how similar their voting
    patterns are. The further apart two MPs are the greater the discord in their
    voting patterns.


    For each MP we gather information about their voting history (or times when
    they where absent). We compare each MP's voting history with the voting
    history of all other MPs and we count how many times each two MPs voted the
    same. Results are represented in a two dimensional matrix (columns and lines
    are MPs, Xi,j value represents the number of times two MPs voted the same -
    MPs are marked as i and j). Then the matrix is split into sub-matrices each
    holding their respective value. 


    The algorithm returns three matrices - u, s and V-transpose. The best way to
    think about V-transpose is as a new selection of MPs' coordinates. We select
    the two coordinates from V-transpose that explain the previous matrix the
    best and visualise them in a two dimensional coordinate system.


    The first matrix is best described as representing MPs in an N-dimensional
    space (N is the number of voting events that are being compared). The
    algorithm maps N dimensions to 2 dimensions, with the priority of
    maintaining the distance between the MPs. Further apart the two MPs, greater
    the difference in their voting history.

    # An overview of all votes which occurred during the session


    For all voting events in a session we count the votes (FOR, AGAINST,
    ABSTAINED) and the number of MPs who were absent, and display the results.


    We obtain voting records from the web page [National Assembly of the
    Republic of Slovenia](http://www.dz-rs.si).


    Unexpected votes


    To mark unexpected voting results we use the probabilistic method of
    analysis of main components, [as implemented in scikit-learn
    papers](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.PCA.html)
    and described in [M. Tipping and C. Bishop, Probabilistic Principal
    Component Analysis, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B, 61,
    Part 3, pp. 611-622](http://www.miketipping.com/papers/met-mppca.pdf).


    We transform all voting events into four-dimensional vectors where each of
    the components shows the number of votes for a specific option (FOR,
    AGAINST, ABSTAINED, ABSENT). Principal component analysis (PCA) model is
    adjusted to the matrix and function
    [score_samples](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/14031f6/sklearn/decomposition/pca.py#L485)
    gives us "log-likelihood" of each voting event in our model. The model is
    set to maximise "log-likelihood" value to as many voting events as possible.
    When we obtain all "log-likelihood" values we sort them from smallest to
    biggest and use a fourth of all voting events which fit the model the least.
    Compared to our model these voting events stand out and are therefore most
    "unexpected". In the card they are marked with a fire icon.

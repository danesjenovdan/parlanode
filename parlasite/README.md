# parlasite

EJS templates and server for serving the actual Parlameter website.

## Developing with docker-compose

See [../README.md](../README.md)

## Installation

Download/clone the git repository and run `yarn`.

## Start local (development) server

Run `yarn dev`. It will serve the website on `localhost:3066` and watch for file changes and restart the server when needed, but you will still need to reload the page in the browser.

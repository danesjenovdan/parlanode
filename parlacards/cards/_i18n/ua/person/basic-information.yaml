    # Overview of the MP's basic information.


    We obtained the content for this card from the web site [National Assembly
    of the Republic of Slovenia](http://www.dz-rs.si/wps/portal/Home/)
    (parliamentary group, age, membership in committees) and the web site of
    State Election Commission (the number of votes received). For all other
    information we contacted PR departments of the parliamentary groups.


    We received information from NSi, SD, (then) ZaAB and ZL. SMC directed us to
    their web site and SDS directed us to the web site of the National Assembly.
    We collected the missing data using the Google search engine and gave all
    the parliamentary parties an opportunity to make corrections before
    publication.

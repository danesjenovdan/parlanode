    # MP's attendance at voting in the National Assembly through time.


    Every month we count all ballots casted by the MP and divide them by the
    number of all voting instances for that month where the MP should have been
    voting. In cases where the MP did not have a term in office in the selected
    month we show the percentage of voting where they did not have the right to
    vote.

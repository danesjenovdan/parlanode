    # Displayed are six pieces of legislation still in procedure and six that
    were recently passed.


    Exposed pieces of legislation are curated by editors based on how much
    interest we feel certain pieces have gathered in the media and civil
    society. This is the only thing on Parlameter not curated by a machine.

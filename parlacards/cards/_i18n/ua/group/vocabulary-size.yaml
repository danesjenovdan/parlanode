    # Diversity of vocabulary of the parliamentary group's MPs, compared to the
    average and maximum values.


    We count the number of unique words and the number of all words spoken in
    all speeches. Then we count the number of times each unique word occurs. We
    divide the words in categories according to the number of times they were
    repeated (once, twice, three times, etc.). In the end we calculate the
    coefficient. To calculate the coefficient we put the number of unique spoken
    words above the fraction bar, and the number of words which are repeated
    with some frequency (once, twice, three times...) multiplied with the square
    of the frequency (one squared, two squared, three squared...) below the
    fraction bar.


    For the phrase "Today is a new day and today is the day for Parlameter" the
    result is 7 / ((3*2^2) + (4*1^2)) = 0,4375

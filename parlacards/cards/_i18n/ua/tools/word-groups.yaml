  title: Word groups
  info: >-
    # The card shows which speakers or which parliamentary groups absolutely and
    relatively talk about a group of words the most.


    We count the times a speaker says at least two search queries. Those, that
    said it at least once are ranked according to the number of occurrences
    divided by the number of all speeches of this speaker or parliamentary group
    and the total number of all speeches.

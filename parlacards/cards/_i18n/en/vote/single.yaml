  title: The vote
  info: >-
    We obtain voting records from the web page of the National Assembly of the
    Republic of Slovenia.


    Results of the vote are displayed in three ways: by the MP, by the
    parliamentary group and by Government - Opposition.


    The first tab gives you an overview of the vote. You can filter results
    according to value of the ballot (FOR, AGAINST, ABSTAINED, ABSENT) and look
    up individual MPs. The majority vote is printed out next to the pie chart.
    For example, "60% FOR" means that 60% of MPs voted FOR.


    The second tab shows parliamentary groups' votes. At the end of each line
    the majority vote of the parliamentary group is printed and pressing the
    button next to it gives you access to a list of MPs who voted the same as
    the majority of the parliamentary group. The lightning sign indicates
    discrepancies within the parliamentary group - it is next to all votes that
    are not the same as the majority vote (MPs who are not present are not
    included). If the majority of the parliamentary group is absent there is no
    majority vote.


    The third tab shows voting results according to Government - Opposition.
    Here again we use the lightning symbol to highlight unexpected votes i.e.
    instances where the MP's vote is different than the majority vote.


    Lightning symbol


    The lightning symbol indicates discrepancies within the parliamentary group
    or within the coalition - it is next to all votes that are not the same as
    the majority vote (MPs who were are present are not included). If the
    majority of the parliamentary group is absent there is no majority vote.

card:
  title: Vote comparator
  info: >-
    The card displays all voting events that match selected criteria. When
    comparing parliamentary groups it calculates the majority vote by counting
    the number of votes for each option and selecting the one with the highest
    number of votes.


    Results are displayed in three ways:


    * as a list of all voting events,

    * as a line chart that shows the number of votes on any given day,

    * as a histogram showing sums of votes based on working bodies.

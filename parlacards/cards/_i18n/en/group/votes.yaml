    # An overview of all votes which occurred during the session.


    For all voting events in a session we count the votes (FOR, AGAINST,
    ABSTAINED) and the number of MPs who were absent and display the results.


    We obtain voting records from the web page [National Assembly of the
    Republic of
    Slovenia](https://www.dz-rs.si/wps/portal/Home/deloDZ/seje/sejeDrzavnegaZbora/PoDatumuSeje).

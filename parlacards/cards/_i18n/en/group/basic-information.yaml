    # Overview of parliamentary group's basic information.


    We obtained the content for this card from the National Assembly web site
    (parliamentary group, age, membership in committees) and the web site of
    State Election Commission (the number of votes received). For all other
    information we contacted PR departments of the parliamentary groups. We
    received information from NSi, SD, (then) ZaAB and ZL. SMC directed us to
    their web site and SDS directed us to the web site of the National Assembly.
    We collected the missing data using the Google search engine and gave all
    the parliamentary parties an opportunity to make corrections before
    publication.

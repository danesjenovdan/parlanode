    # The number of amendments the parliamentary group introduced, compared to
    maximum and average value of amendments per parliamentary groups.


    We identify the number of parliamentary groups' MPs by counting all of their
    currently active members. The information regarding that is retrieved from
    the web page [National Assembly of the Republic of
    Slovenia](http://www.dz-rs.si/wps/portal/Home/ODrzavnemZboru/KdoJeKdo/PoslanskeSkupine).

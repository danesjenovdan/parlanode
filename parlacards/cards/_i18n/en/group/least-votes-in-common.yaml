  title: Least often vote the same
  info: >-
    # List of 5 MPs who most often vote differently than the "vote of the
    parliamentary group". MPs are ranked in a descending order. The higher the
    value, the lower the commonalities between the two MPs.


    We calculate the Euclidean distance between the results of a parliamentary
    group's voting and everyone else's voting (votes are converted to numerical
    values between -1 and 1).


    We calculate the "distance" between all the MPs, rank them based on results
    and show the top 5.


    The numerical values of votes


    * -1: against

    * 0: abstained or absent

    * 1: for

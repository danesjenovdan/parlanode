    # An overview of parliamentary questions by parliamentary group.


    We collected all parliamentary questions and sorted them by parliamentary
    groups. Questions can be viewed by the MP who gave them, by the person to
    whom the question was addressed to, and by date. It is also possible to
    search through questions by their title.


    We obtain records of parliamentary questions from the web page [National
    Assembly of the Republic of
    Slovenia](https://www.dz-rs.si/wps/portal/Home/deloDZ/seje/sejeDrzavnegaZbora/PoDatumuSeje).

  title: Deviation from the parliamentary group
  info: >-
    # MP's vote deviation from the majority vote of their parliamentary group,
    compared to the average and maximum values.


    For all voting events we calculate the majority vote for each parliamentary
    group. Majority vote refers to the option that a majority of the MP's voted
    for.


    For each MP we identify their current parliamentary group and we calculate
    the percentage of matching votes during the period of their membership. In
    all calculations we ignore the ballot "not present".

  title: Avg. number of speeches per session
  info: >-
    # The average number of speeches by the MP compared to the average and
    maximum values.


    We count the MP's speeches found in transcripts retrieved from the web site
    [National Assembly of the Republic of
    Slovenia](https://www.dz-rs.si/wps/portal/Home/deloDZ/seje/sejeDrzavnegaZbora/PoDatumuSeje)
    and divide it by the number of sessions the MP attended. We divide the
    number of all speeches first by the number of all the MPs and then by the
    number of all sessions (where speeches were made). We compare the individual
    result with the average and maximum values.

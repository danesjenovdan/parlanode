  title: Most likely to vote the same
  info: >-
    # List of 5 MPs that most often vote the same as the selected member. MPs
    are ranked ascending. The lower the value, the bigger the commonalities
    between the two MPs.


    We calculate [Euclidean
    distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance) between the
    results of the MP's voting and everyone else's voting (values of votes are
    converted to numerical values between -1 and 1).


    We calculate the "distance" between all the MPs, rank them based on the
    results and show the top 5.


    Votes' numerical values


    * -1: against

    * 0: abstained or absent

    * 1: for

  title: Least often vote the same
  info: >-
    # List of 5 MPs who most often vote differently than the selected MP. MPs
    are ranked in a descending order. The higher the value, the lower the
    commonalities between the two MPs.


    We calculate [Euclidean
    distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance) between the
    results of the MP's voting and everyone else's voting (values of votes are
    converted to numerical values between -1 and 1).


    When we calculate the "distance" between all the MPs we rank them according
    to their result and show the last (i.e. furthest removed) five.


    The numerical values of votes


    * -1: against

    * 0: abstained or absent

    * 1: for

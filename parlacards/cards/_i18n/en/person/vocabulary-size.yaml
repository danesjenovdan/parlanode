    # Vocabulary strength, compared to average and maximum values.


    We count the number of unique words and the number of all words spoken in
    all speeches given by the MP. Then we count the number of times each unique
    word occurs. We divide the unique words in categories according to the
    number of times they were repeated (once, twice, three times, etc.).


    In the end we calculate the coefficient. To calculate the coefficient we put
    the number of unique words above the fraction bar and the number of words
    which are repeated with some frequency (once, twice, three times...)
    multiplied with the square of the frequency (one squared, two squared, three
    squared...) below the fraction bar.


    For the phrase "Today is a new day and today is the day for Parlameter" the
    result is 7 / ((3*2^2) + (4*1^2)) = 0,4375
